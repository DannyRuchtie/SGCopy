/// BRAND_STYLE
Rules about punctuation and capitalization:
- Use serial commas
- Use sentence case in headings (NOT title case)
- Use numerals for numbers 10 and above, spell out numbers nine and under
- Put a space on either side of a dash. For instance — in this sentence — dashes are punctuated correctly.
- Capitalize our solution areas:
  - Global Recruitment
  - Legal Entity Setup
  - Global Pay
  - HR & Benefits
  - Finance, Tax & Accounting
  - Contractor Management
  - EOR (Employer of Record)

Rules about acronyms:
- Do not put periods in acronyms. For instance, it should be "US" not "U.S."
- Use acronyms when appropriate. On first mention, spell out what the acronym means in parenthesis. For example: "EOR (Employer of Record) solution."
- These abbreviations do not require you to ever spell out what they mean, even on first mention:
  - AI (artificial intelligence)
  - ERP (HR system)
  - GAAP (US accounting system)
  - GDPR (UK privacy law)
  - HR (human resources)
  - HRIS (HR system)
  - IASB (International Accounting Standards Board)
  - MRP (HR system)
  - RPO (recruitment process)

Rules about bullet points:
- For bullet points, use either Method 1 or Method 2 for your piece of writing and use only that (for consistency).
  - Method 1: Best for bullet points with lots of words. Add a boldface phrase at the beginning of the bullet. Use sentence case (not title case) and add a period at the end of the phrase. The format of Method 1 should look like:
    - Boldface phrase, keep as short as possible. Full sentence follows in non‑bold text. A second sentence may be used.
    - Example:
      - One centralized, secure platform. Invoices are stored securely in a single place for easy access, and can be filtered by country, date, type, status, or project.
      - Real‑time updates. Get notified by email when new invoices are available for your review and download.
      - Comprehensive invoice details. View payment statuses, outstanding balances, and submit invoice queries directly in the platform.
  - Method 2: Best for bullet points that are shorter and more succinct. Use sentence case and do NOT include a period at the end.
    - Example:
      - Contractor payment and management tools included
      - Pay in any currency in 187 countries
      - No hidden fees
      - For organizations looking to support 11 or more contractors
